Sub::Installer version 0.0.2

This module provides two universal methods that any package/class can
use to install subroutines in its own namespace.

For example, you can write:

    $ref = $PackageName->install_sub({ $sub_name => $sub_ref });

instead of writing the less-maintainable:

    $ref = do {
        no strict 'refs';
        *{$PackageName.'::'.$subname} = $sub_ref;
    }



INSTALLATION

Alternatively, to install with Module::Build, you can use the following commands:
